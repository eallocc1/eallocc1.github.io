About Eddie Allocca
------
My name is Eddie Allocca.  I'm a senior Geography and Environmental Science B.S. Major at the University of Maryland Baltimore County graduating on May 25, 2023.  I'm from Bogota, Colombia but grew up in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  At UMBC, I took part in the UMBC Racing team all 3/4 years, which is part of the SAE Collegiate Design Baja program.

Interests
------
I have various interests.  Msinly, my interest falls in the agricuture and automotive industries.  I'm primarily looking for a career in agriculture, more specifically agronomy or as a farm/ranchhand.  In terms of agronomy, I want to be able to help farmers improve their crops and soil health with certain products and using remote sensing data to look at how the fields can be improved based on aspects such as amount of water in the soil.  I'm interested in being a farm/ranchand because it's the work I've done for years and what I know.  I like being able to use my mechanical abilities as well as my environmental science knowledge amd construction ability to help provide better fields and crops and to repair, maintain, and build vehicles and buildings on farms.  In terms of automotive industry, I'm intereted in the automotive and technician fields.  I'm interested in careers that have work where I'm contantly imteracting with things and not sitting at a desk.

Research and Work Experience
------
During my senior year at UMBC, I performed research with Dr. Dillon Mahmoudi.  During my research, I studied the levels of lead within urban gardens in Baltimore, Maryland.  One garden was the community garden on the UMBC Campus and the other was located in Patterson Park in the city of Baltimore.  The results of this research are in the portfolio section of my GitHub website.  I used a cheap lead test including a test strip and a reagant that was mixed with the soil.  The test strip was dipped into the soil-reagant mixture and then we waited 2 minutess for a 400 ppm lead level or 10 minutes for a 100 ppm level.  The color on the strip after this time was then compared to the instrctions sheet to see whether it was positive or negative for lead.  Based on these results.  We found that the most likely source of lead contamination of urban gardens in Baltimore is from automotive products.

I've previously worked on a farm call Love & Grit Farm.  It's a new, small farm located in Germantown, Maryland.  This farm focused on sustainable organic agriculture.  The farm collected food waste through a program from people in the community and created compost from it.  We also used products to remove and attract pests as well as improve soil and plant health that were mabe from natural materials.  I like working on this farm because it helped introduce me to all the sustainable methods of agriculture.  The farm also had 2 goats, pigs that were used for meat, and chickens that were also used for meat.  I was also able to learn more mechanical and construction knowledge through certain projects to improve the farm and help the plants grow better.

Since the beginning of 2023, I've worked on Full Moon Farm in Finksburg, Maryland.  Full Moon Farm is a fairly large horse farm, and has helped me gain a lot of experience in equine handling and care.  Not only yhat, but I was able to gain experience in the construction and maintence of equine facilities such as the indoor competition arena on the farm.  Working on the farm introduced me to a whole new side of agriculture regarding livestock and it's increased my my interest in this aspect of the field.
