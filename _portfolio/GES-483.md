title: "483 Lead Information"

excerpt: "Urban agriculture and urban gardening are becoming an increasingly important part of today’s society, especially with a growing population and urban sprawl.  Urban agriculture and gardening play an important role in urban areas as it can help bring fresh and healthy foods to communities that are in need of them, and local produce to urban areas.  However, monitoring the health of the urban gardens is vital to human and crop health.  Urban areas are at risk of various contaminants because of their closeness to industry and the transportation within cities.  Many urban areas contain lots of contaminants such as those from manufacturing and industry, cars, and many other causes.  “Lead is the most common contaminant in urban soils” (Brown et al. 27) and “Lead has been shown to persist in soils, sometimes for centuries” (Schwarz et. al, 32).  Fertilizers and compost added into the soil in the gardens may increase contaminants such as lead in soil after repeated use.  Naturally occurring lead levels in urban soils are about 150 mg/kg, however some urban areas can have an excess of 1000 mg/kg (Brown et al. 27).  As a comparison, the EPA Hazard Level of Lead in the soil is 400 mg/kg.  This higher level of lead in the soil can lead to a decrease in the pH of the soil.  One of the sources of lead in urban soils comes from paint.  “...89% of exterior residential structures built before 1978…” (Clark et. al, 312) contain lead.  In older cities such as Baltimore, this can play a major role in lead contamination.  Contaminants in the soil such as lead can then affect the health of people in many ways, and people can be contaminated through consumption of contaminated foods or through the inhalation of dust in the air.  Other soil contaminants include pesticides, petroleum products, radon, and asbestos.  Various metals contaminate urban soils as well.  Besides the previously mentioned lead, metal contaminants in urban soils include zinc, copper, chromium, and nickel.  It’s important to study the levels of lead in urban garden soils not just for human health, but also because “...Pb emitted in past decades exists in urban areas, particularly in soils.” (Sung and Park, 38)."

<h1>The Results!</h1>

<h3>Sample Location Maps</h3>
This map looks at the UMBC Community Garden.  It includes each of the 10 sample locations and each of the 9 plot rows within the community garden.  This map was primarily used to find the sample locations in the field as well as to help people understand the sample locations and their correlation to the community garden plots and surrounding area.  All plots were in slightly raised beds with wooden borders.  Each individual plot is a 3x3 foot plot with the end plots being triangular.

This map shows the sample locations in the Patterson Park Community Garden with the garden extent behind it.  Points 1 and 2 were taken in the exact same location, which is in a bed that wasn’t raised and had no border.  No plants were being grown in the plots.  Points 3 and 4 were located on the path at the back of the garden next to the heavy machinery lot.  It was between a plot and the outer fence.  Point 5 was located in a raised bed with a plant that looked like beans growing in it.  There was a wooden border going around the plot similar to those in the UMBC Community Garden.

<h3>Ordinary Kriging Maps</h3>
This map shows the ordinary kriging data for lead contamination in the UMBC community garden.  Looking at the map, we can see some trends within the data.  One of these trends is that the lead has a tendency to be located within the plots as compared to in grass areas outside the plots.  The other trend is that the grass areas tested tended to be negative for lead.  There’s one exception to these trends; point 9, which is a point located in a grass area within the garden tested positive for lead.  I would assume this is likely due to the fact that it’s located in a drainage ditch and it absorbed the contaminants through runoff water from the garden and neighboring parking lot.

This map shows an ordinary kriging map of lead contamination in the Patterson Park community garden.  The red represents the highest lead values while green represents the lowest values of lead contamination.  We can see that the highest concentration of lead contamination is located next to the garage and heavy equipment parking.  This heavy equipment included tractors and other vehicles with hydraulic components.  Hydraulic fluid can contain traces of metals in it such as lead.  Most tractors and other heavy equipment have hydraulic systems.  With the tractors being older, its likely that hydraulic fluid and other mechanical fluids leaked from the tractors and got into the garden from runoff from the parking lot.  The trend of decreasing lead value from the heavy equipment parking further proves the claim that the lead contamination had likely come from the lot.

<h3>Semivariograms</h3>
The first figure is a semivariogram based on prediction ordinary kriging for lead in the UMBC Community Garden.  The line going through the center of each chart is the range (For this image and the next).  Many of the points are far from the range, signaling that the data is not very autocorrelated.  There are also many points near to the range so it could also be considered to be autocorrelated.

The second figure is a semivariogram based on prediction ordinary kriging for lead level in the Patterson Park Community Garden. Most points aren't near the range signaling the data isn't very autocorrelated.  However, this can be considered with some error as the sample size was very small which likely had an effect on the results.  I also found it interesting that the range appears to remain constant in the first figure and a strong logarithmic line in the second graph.
